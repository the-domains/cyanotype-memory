Our founding fathers established a respected and profound tradition of oratorical sesquipedalianism. Their intent was to direct the unwashed masses of the American public away from tyranny and hedonism, away from populism and Catholicism, away from Asians and Irish, and away from those diabolical Finnish. They wanted to direct the country towards moderate corporate tax structures and an immigration system geared towards Anglo-Saxon racial purity. These visionaries realized it could be as uncomplicated and straightforward as choosing the most intensely syllable laden words from the godforsaken depths of an 18th century philosopher's annotated thesaurus.

There once was a time when inspiring the best in Americans only required invoking biblically sound prognostications concerning the end of days. I look forward to a time when it takes more than poorly recalled nostalgia to bring the American people to ever higher achievement. Facing the threat of self destruction, we must reach for strength unaccompanied by the pitfalls of pride and tyranny while maintaining a sense of exceptionalism.

America has come to lament the day we allowed the liberal arts to end the character building practices of prescriptive linguistic fascism. We rue the loss of our father language. Everyday the furthest boundaries of our language are besieged by neglect and relegated to the annals of ghosts. Our father tongue is ceding territory to ignorance. In short order, the expanse of our vernacular shall be altogether too inadequate to buttress the force of American ingenuity and intellectualism. America is in desperate need of reclaiming its pedantic, patrician, languid voice.

Perhaps, if one had the sensibility to mix in terms that reduced the fallibility of one's statements, you could shield yourself from having been erroneous. It is almost certainly commonly believed that disclaimers and convoluted argumentation could, most likely, ensure, to a degree, that even the most undocumented of anecdotes could, within reason, traipse about as being more closely associated to the appearance of fact than fabrication.

It is certainly approaching the truth to understand that in our past America has strived towards the tactile, social accomplishments of infrastructure and space flight. It is almost apparent to most of us that we have indeed reached those accomplishments. In opposition to societal progress and collective power, Trump reduces us to the vague darwinian terms of 'winning' and 'losing'. By voicing the drivel of his psyche in repetitive, brachysyllabic blurbs, Donald J. Trump attacks the foundations of America's freedom loving, semi-democratic, hulking bureaucracy.
